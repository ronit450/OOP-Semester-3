
auto A 
auto is the keyword in c++ which will determine the data type of A automatically.
example

auto A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}


as in python we have loops such as 
for i in x   where  is some list

in c++ we do
for (int count: A){
    cout<<count<<" "<<endl;
}
we cant use pointer array for this method. 

The second thing alternate to Array in C++ is Vector. Array can only be of fixed length but we can add items in vectors
vector <int> A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
vector.pushback(8)

it will add 8 to the end of vector
to iterate:
for(int count: A){
 cout<<count   
}
there is a operation of vector
lets say we run a loop till 50 but there are onlly 12 elements in vector. 
After printing 12 elements it will start throwing garbage value so to avoid that we use .alternate
for (int count = 0; count<50; count++){
    cout<<A.at[i]<<" "<<endl;
}
