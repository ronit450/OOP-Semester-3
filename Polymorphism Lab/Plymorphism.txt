So when we write the code for polymorphism so we override the function

override means the function is present in parent class and in all child class as well

lets say we have a animal class and three child class as dog, cat and cow and there is a function named as make_sound() which7
will be same in parent class and child class as well.

now for parent class we will use virtual keyword to differntitate with the child class.

for example::
class animal{
    virtual void make_sound(){

    }
}
class Dog: public animal{
    void make_sound(){
        
    }
}
