How to create Objects Dynamically
Lets say if we have any type of Class such as Disatance class having attirbutes such as Int x and Int y.

Now If we want to use Pointers to create a Objects the syntax is

Disatance *Ptr 
Ptr = new Disatance(2,11)

this is will create a dynamic Disatance object of values 2 and 11

after this all the functions of this ptr will be called by '->' this such as if class has function of show so 
 
 ptr -> show(); will be used

 After this we also have to delete the ptr also
 delete ptr

We can also create the arrays of pointer type as well
ptr = new Disatance[10];

for (int i = 0; i<10;i++){
    ptr[i] = Disatance(2,i);
}
for (int i = 0; i<10, i++){
    ptr[i].show();
    (ptr+i) -> show();
    (*(ptr+i)).show();

    these two are thee representation of the same thing as they are methonds used to access the functions of class
}

delete [] ptr   = This deleted the array of objects
